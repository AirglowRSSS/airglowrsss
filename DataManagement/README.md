# AirGlow-RSSS
Tools to support the understanding the dynamics of the ionosphere using a
combination of optical and radio techniques. This is accomplished through 
instrument development, experimental campaigns, and data analysis. 
[Our group](https://airglow.ece.illinois.edu/) is 
part of the Remote Sensing & Space Science group in the Department of Electrical 
and Computer Engineering. We are always looking for students interested in becoming 
involved in our research, especially those with a background in signal/image 
processing, plasma physics, or optical/radio instrument design.
